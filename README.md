# Mobile first aproach

To develop this project I aplied th mobile first aproach because two reasons:

1. Most of people now a days use their mobile phones to access the web.

2. Since mobile layout is simpler (less columns) than desktop layout (more columns), then it requires less styles and then with media queries is easier and more eficient adapt the layout to desktops than the other way around. It also helps avoid over riding styles which happens more often with the desktop first aproach.

# Vertical rhythm

I aplied vertical rhythm to typography on this project because it looks very profesional and elegant. 

Vertical rhythm makes text fit on a regular vertical pattern somthing like if you were writing on a notebook with horizontal lines as guides.

# Max width for independent text

To increase redability I took care independent text lines were not to long (less than 70 characters long is recomended).

When lines of text are very long is dificult to return to the beguining of the next lines for readers.
